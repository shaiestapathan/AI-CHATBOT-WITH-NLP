DESCRIPTION:

This project was created for Task 3 of the CodTech Python Internship, which focuses on building a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries or concepts. The goal of the task is to make an intelligent chatbot that can answer user queries, provide responses based on logic, and fetch data from external sources such as Wikipedia.

🧸 What is Pookie?
Pookie is a cute, friendly chatbot designed to interact with users in a warm, fun, and cheerful way. It uses custom logic for casual chatting and leverages the Wikipedia API to fetch real-world information when needed. It is built using Python’s Tkinter library for the GUI and the Wikipedia module for fetching summaries of user queries.

✨ Key Features
🐾 Friendly responses to greetings like “hi”, “how are you”, “bye”, “love you”, etc.
🧠 Smart fallback to Wikipedia summaries when a question isn’t predefined
⏳ Typing animation before bot responses

📜 Hamburger menu with:
View History
Clear History
Exit

🐰 Beautiful, dark-themed GUI with soft colors and bubble-style chat layout
💬 Support for emoji-rich, adorable responses
📜 Maintains chat history and allows clearing it with one click
🎨 Color-coded chat bubbles (pink for bot, white for user)

🛠 Technologies Used
Component	Usage
Python	Core language
Tkinter	GUI framework for the app
Wikipedia	External data fetching
Messagebox	User notifications and alerts

🧠 How It Works
The chatbot listens to user input and checks for common phrases like:

“hi”, “hello” → returns a friendly welcome
“how are you?” → responds with cute text
“your name?”, “who made you?” → gives fun answers

If the user enters anything outside predefined phrases, it tries to fetch a 2-sentence summary from Wikipedia using wikipedia.summary().
The GUI is responsive and scrollable, with each message displayed in a custom chat bubble. The app begins with a welcome message from Pookie and continues interacting with user inputs typed in a text box at the
bottom.
A typing indicator is displayed for a short delay before showing the bot’s response, adding realism to the chat experience.

💡 What I Learned
This project helped me understand how to:
Use Tkinter to create interactive and professional GUI apps
Use Wikipedia API to fetch and handle live data
Structure a chatbot's response system using conditional logic
Manage chat history, user interface events, and custom layouts
Make the app more interactive with animations and emoji-based UI

📌 Why It’s Unique
Unlike basic bots that respond with plain text, Pookie stands out with:
A cute personality
A playful visual design
Real-time knowledge access through Wikipedia
User-focused features like history, clear, and exit options

🧾 Conclusion
Pookie the Chatbot is a great example of how logic, user interface design, and real-world data can come together to create a fun, educational, and interactive application. This project reflects skills that are valuable in NLP, UI/UX design, and intelligent software development
